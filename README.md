# Fetal Health Classification
This project focuses on performing classification tasks on the "Fetal Health Classification" dataset available on Kaggle. The goal is to apply K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree algorithms to predict the health status of a fetus based on various features.

## Dataset Description
The "Fetal Health Classification" dataset consists of various cardiotocogram (CTG) features and the corresponding fetal health classification labels. The features include accelerations, fetal movement, uterine contractions, etc. The dataset is labeled with three classes: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological, representing different health statuses of the fetus.
